// Code-
var x = 1;
a();
b();
console.log(x);

function a() {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x);
}

function b() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x);
}

// Output-
// 10
// 100
// 1

Summary 1:
1. We learnt how functions work in JS. 
2. At first a global execution context is created, which consists of Memory and code and has 2 phases: Memory allocation phase and code execution phase. 
3. In the first phase, the variables are assigned "undefined" while functions have their own code. 
4. Whenever there is a function declaration in the code, a separate local execution context gets created having its own phases and is pushed into the call stack. 
5. Once the function ends, the EC is removed from the call stack. 
6. When the program ends, even the global EC is pulled out of the call stack.

Summary 1:
1) The higher level of the GEC on the stack, higher its preference 
2) GEC is created as the function is invoked and destroyed as its execution is completed 
3) same variable names but different scope of execution separates the variable values

/* **************Episode 005: SHORTEST JS Program üî•window & this keyword - 08/06/2023************** */
/*
var a = 10;
console.log(window.a);
console.log(a);
console.log(this.a);

// Output-
// 10
// 10
// 10
*/

Summary:
1. Shortest Program in JS: Empty file. Still, browsers make global EC and global space along with Window object.
2. Global Space: Anything that is not in a function, is in the global space.
3. Variables present in a global space can be accessed by a "window" object. (like window.a)
4. In global space, (this === window) object.

Notes:
‚Ä¢ window object is created by the JS engines of the respective browsers when global execution context is created.
‚Ä¢ whenever an execution context is created a "this" variable is also created.
‚Ä¢ at the global level "this" points to the global object( window object in case of browsers).
‚Ä¢ anything that is not inside a function is the "global space".
‚Ä¢ whenever we create any variables or functions in the "global space", they get attached to the global object( window object in case of browsers).

so to access the variables/function defined in the global space , 
we can use any of the below:
  var a = 10;
  console.log(window.a);
  console.log(a);
  console.log(this.a)             //at the global space level, where this points to the window object

/* **************Episode 006: undefined vs not defined in JS ü§î - 08/06/2023************** */
/*
Summary-
1. Undefined is like a placeholder till a variable is not assigned a value.
2. undefined !== not defined
3. JS- weakly typed language since it doesn't depend on data type declarations.
4. Understand the difference between undefined and not defined in JS. 5. 5. Many developers assume that undefined is exactly the same as not defined, but that's not true. 
6. undefined is a value in JavaScript and in fact, it also takes up memory space.  
***undefined is not a keyword. It is a global read-only variable which represents the value undefined.

var a;
console.log(a);
a = 10;
console.log(a);
a = 'Hello World!';
console.log(a);

// Output-
// undefined
// 10
// Hello World!
